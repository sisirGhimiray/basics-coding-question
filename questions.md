# Question
 **01** .Write a function to encrypt text and to decrypt the encrypted text. <br>
**(i)** Perform the encryption so that every character is replaced by its next character. For example <br>
    replaced by its next character. For example replace a by b, b by c and so on, replace z by a. <br>
**(ii)** Perform the encoding according to these replacements <br>
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z <br>
m n k g h d t a b w v u p r q c z j x i e y f l o s <br>


**02** .Write a program to enter a positive 4 digit number and display it in words.


**03** . Write a recursive functions for finding length of a string and displaying the string in front and reverse order. <br>
*A string can be defined recursively as-* <br>
**i**. A string may be an empty string.<br>
**ii**. A string may be a character followed by a smaller string(one character less).<br>


**04** Write a function to convert a string into upperCase. <br>

**05** Write a function for performing case insensitive string comparision. <br>

**06** Unlike gets(),the function fgets() does'nt delete the new line character
        entered at the end but retains it. What should we do if we don't want the newLine character in the
        string. <br>

**07** Write a function to remove all leading and trailing blanks. <br>

**08** Input a string and change it so that the characters are placed in alphabetic order.
for example the string "John smith" should be changed to "hhiJmnost" <br>

**09** write a program to abbreviate input text. For example if the input is "World Heath Organisation"
then the output should be WHO. <br>

**10** Write a function to to  extract a substring from a string. Assume that the substring starts at the ith character(start counting from 0th character) and is n character long. <br>


**11** Write a function to replace adjacent multiple spaces in a string by a single space. <br>

**12** write your own pointer versions of the library functions strncpy(),strncmp(),strncat()
